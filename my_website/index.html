                <p>This is my first static website which I have built with basic HTML and CSS. I started with the basic template in HTML and then proceeded with the styling with CSS. For a beginner it looks pretty fine, doesn’t it? I started this so that I can start with web dev which I further want to improve upon.</p>
                <h2>Why dark?</h2>
                <p>Because it looks cool. Not just it looks cool to my brain but also it is cool to my eye, literally. Apart from that we just don’t appreciate the presence of the color black in our day-to-day life enough, it should be noted that we can only see the stars because the sky is dark at night. Dark is the new bright.</p>
                <p>My next move naturally should be to build a better webpage that could be more interactive and fun to visit, I have seen plenty of videos on different webpages which really look awesome. I hope I’ll also build some good-looking webpages which people will appreciate.</p>
                    
                <p>I request you all to you all to support me in this journey which I have chosen to walk with unknown people along side. Danke shon</p>

                <h2>About my right brain:</h2>
                <p>This part of my brain likes to do creative stuff like art and thinking philosophy. You can see my artwork and incoming philosophical quotes on my Instagram account and be a part of my fantasy which is weird as yours.</p>
                <h2>About my left brain:</h2>
                <p>Apart from thinking weird stuff I also like to think logically to come to a particular conclusion which I very much required in this formula-driven world. I solve reasoning questions from various domains like mathematics, computer science, and game theory.</p>
                <h2>Other hobbies:</h2>
                <p>I like talking to people because it gives me a great insight into different things looking from their perspective. I just like how people are so smart sometimes without them even knowing, meh. I am also very into sports because of how it is like controlling the most complicated rc robot in the world which we have full control over.</p>
